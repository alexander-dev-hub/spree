    <H2>JSON API features supported</H2>
    All REST API v2 endpoints support these JSON API features:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ExternalLink url="https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships">
          Relationships
        </ExternalLink>
        <br />
        Returns a set of related objects IDs the same response JSON
      </li>
      <li>
        <ExternalLink url="https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes">
          Fetching Related Resources
        </ExternalLink>
        <br />
        In one API request you can fetch multiple resources related to the main
        object, eg. Product with Variants and Images of those Variants.
        Thanks to this you don't need to make multiple requests to the API greatly
        simplyfying your frontend code and also creating a smoother experience
        for your users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <ExternalLink url="https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets">
          Sparse Fieldsets
        </ExternalLink>
        <br />
        Fetch only selected attributes of objects and their relationships.
        Thanks to this JSON response will be lean and exactly how you require it
        without any overload and overfetching.
      </li>
    </ul>
