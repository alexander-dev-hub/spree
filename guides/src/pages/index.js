            The REST API is designed to give developers a convenient way to
            access data contained within Spree. With a standard read/write
            interface to store data, it is now very simple to write third party
            applications (JavaScript/Mobile/other technologies) that can talk to
            your Spree store.

          <Section path="/developer" title="Developer Guides">
            This part of Spreeâ€™s documentation covers the technical aspects of

          <Section path="/user" title="User Guides">
            This documentation is intended for business owners and site
