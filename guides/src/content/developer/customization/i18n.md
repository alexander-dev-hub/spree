## Overview

This guide covers how Spree uses Rails' internationalization features, and how
you can leverage and extend these features in your Spree contributions and
extensions.

## How Spree i18n works

Spree uses the standard Rails approach to internationalization so we suggest
take some time to review the
[official Rails i18n guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) to help you
get started.

## The spree_i18n project

Spree now stores all of the translation information in a separate GitHub project
known as [spree_i18n](https://github.com/spree/spree_i18n). This is a stand
alone project with a large number of volunteer committers who maintain the
locale files. This is basically the same approach followed by the Rails project
which keeps their localizations in
[rails-i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n).

The project is actually a Spree extension. This extension contains translations files.
To translate models (provide translations for Products, Taxons, etc) you will need to install
also [spree_globalize](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_globalize).

### Translation Files

Each language is stored in a YAML file located in `config/locales`. Each YAML
file contains one top level key which is the language code for the translations
contained within that file.  The following is a snippet showing the basic layout
of a locale file:

```yaml
pt-BR:
  spree:
    say_no: "NÃ£o"
    say_yes: "Sim"
```

<alert kind="note">
All translations for Spree are "namespaced" within the `spree` key so that they
don't conflict with translations from other parts of the parent application.
</alert>

### Localization Files

Spree maintains its localization information in a YAML file using a naming
convention similar to that of the Rails project.  Each of the localization
filenames contains a prefix representing the language code of the locale. For
example, the Russian translation is contained in `config/locales/ru.yml`.

<alert kind="note">
Spree has over 43 locale files and counting.  See the [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/spree/spree_i18n/tree/master/config/locales) for a
complete list.
</alert>

### Required Files

Each locale that you wish to support will require both a Rails and Spree
translation.  The required Spree translation files are available automatically
when you install the `spree_i18n` gem.

You don't need to copy any files from `spree_i18n` or `rails-i18n` for their
translations to be available within your application. They are made available
automatically, because both `spree_i18n` and `rails-i18n` are railties.

## Translating Views

When reviewing the source of any view in Spree you'll notice that all text is
rendered by passing a string to a helper method similar to:

```erb
<%= Spree.t(:price) %>
```

The *Spree.t()* helper method looks up the currently configured locale and retrieves
the translated value from the relevant locale YAML file. Assuming a default
locale, this translation would be fetched from the en translations collated from
the application, `spree_i18n` and `rails-i18n`. Its relative key within those
translation files would need to be this:

```yaml
en:
  spree:
    price: Price
```

&nbsp;

## Model Translations

Like mentioned before to translate models you will need to install [Spree Globalize extension](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_globalize) which uses [Globalize](https://github.com/globalize/globalize) library under the hood.

This gem will allow you to translate:

- Products
- Promotions
- Option Types
- Taxonomies
- Taxons
- Properties
- Shipping Methods

## The Default Locale

Since Spree is basically a Rails application it has the same default locale as
any Rails application.  The default locale is `en` which use the English
language.  We can verify this in the rails console

```ruby
>> I18n.locale
=> :en
```

You can also see in the console how the default locale values are translated
into English

```ruby
>> Spree.t(:action)
=> Action
```

&nbsp;

## Setting the Default Locale

The default locale for Rails, and therefore Spree, is `en`. This can be changed by setting
`config.i18n.default_locale` in `config/application.rb`. This setting is ignored
unless the relevant translation file are within `#{Rails.root}/config/locales`
or the `spree_i18n` gem.

## Setting the Default Currency

We're parsing the prices through the [Money gem](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money) which
will display prices consistently across all I18n locales. To change the
currency for your site, go to Admin, then Configuration, then General Settings.
Changing the currency will only change the currency symbol across all prices of
your store.

There are configuration options for currency:

* `Spree::Config[:currency]`: 3-letter currency code representing the current currency.

This options should be set in `config/initializers/spree.rb` file in your application.

## Multi-currency support

To add multiple currency support to your application please install [Multi Currency extension](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_multi_currency).

## Localizing Seed Data

Spree use [Carmen](https://github.com/jim/carmen) to seed the Country and State data. You can localize the seed data by adding Carmen configuration to your `seeds.rb`. See example below:

```ruby
# add Carmen counfiguration with the following 2 lines
require 'carmen'
Carmen.i18n_backend.locale = :ja

Spree::Core::Engine.load_seed if defined?(Spree::Core)
Spree::Auth::Engine.load_seed if defined?(Spree::Auth)
```

## Creating and Modifying Locales

Please submit Pull Requests or issues directly to [spree_i18n](https://github.com/spree/spree_i18n) for missing translations.

## Localizing Extensions

Spree extensions can contain their own `config/locales` directory where
developers can include YAML files for each language they wish to support.

We strongly urge all extension developers to ensure all customer facing text is
rendered via the `Spree.t()` helper method even if they only include a single default
language locale file (as other users can simply include the required YAML file
and translations in their site extension).

<alert kind="note">
Since Spree extensions are equivalent to Rails Engines they can provide
localization information automatically (just like a standalone Rails
application.)
