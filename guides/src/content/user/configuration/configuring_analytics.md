## Introduction

Understanding your site's visitor traffic patterns are important for planning your company's marketing and growth strategies.

### Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce and Segment Ecommerce

In order to enable Spree Analytics Tracker this extension is required: https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_analytics_trackers. We extracted it from core Spree.

Spree's Admin Interface makes it easy for you to add the robust Google Analytics and Segment toolset to your site.

Both Google Analytics and Segment supports detail information of your's site. Spree allows to integrate both to show live detailed events, e.g. on what step of checkout the user stopped or how long it took to complete it.

Also Segment.com allows you to plug-in a lot of additional vendors and services like:

* Mixpanel
* Kissmetrics
* Google Tag Manager
* Facebook Pixels
* Google Adwords remarketing
* [and hundreds others](https://segment.com/catalog/#integrations/all)

This integration gives you control without any additional help from developer side.
This means that you can plan your strategies for marketing and track it without interrupting their job. Isn't that great?
