Spree uses a very flexible and effective system to calculate shipping. This set of guides explains how Spree renders shipping options to your customers at checkout, how it calculates expected costs, and how you can configure your store with your own shipping options to fit your needs.

* [Shipping Categories](/user/shipments/shipping_categories.html)
* [Zones](/user/shipments/zones.html)
* [Calculators](/user/shipments/calculators.html) (to determine shipping rates)
* [Shipping Methods](/user/shipments/shipping_methods.html)

Let's begin by understanding what [Shipping Categories](/user/shipments/shipping_categories.html) are and how you can use them to differentiate products in your store.
