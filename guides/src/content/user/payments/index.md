Processing payments for orders is a very important component of your Spree store. The flexibility of this system allows you to add, remove, or change [methods of payment](/user/payments/payment_methods.html) to suit your needs, as well as to use almost any [payment gateway](/user/payments/payment_methods.html#add-a-supported-gateway) you prefer.

The guides in this section will also help you to understand the [states an order goes through](/user/payments/payment_states.html) from the time the first item is added to the cart, to the time you close out the fulfillment process.
